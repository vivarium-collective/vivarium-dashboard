"""Investigation report: verdict-annotated study DAG + acceptance roll-up.

The report is now rendered server-side by ``lib.investigation_report`` and its
template (the old client-side ``_buildInvestigationReportHtml`` was removed). Its
verdict DAG has nodes = member studies, edges from ``parent_studies``, each badged
with the code-computed gate verdict in one of five states; plus an acceptance
roll-up. These assert the template's render source (the direct analog of the old
walkthrough.js source checks); the data-shape coverage — that the spine block is
actually populated with nodes/edges/verdicts — lives in
``test_investigation_report.py``.
