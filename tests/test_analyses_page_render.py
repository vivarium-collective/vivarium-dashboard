"""Analysis Tools tab: tools-first frontend + removed header/paragraph.

The tab no longer carries a redundant in-page ``<h2>Analysis Tools</h2>``
(the nav rail already labels it) nor the descriptive "Interactive scenes…"
paragraph. Its cards are driven by ``GET /api/analysis-tools`` (built-in
tools + external viewers, each capability-matched).

Uses the ``dashboard_client`` FACTORY fixture against a throwaway copy of the
ws_increase_demo fixture (see tests/test_api_analysis_tools.py).
