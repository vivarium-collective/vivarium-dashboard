"""Regression guard for the Composites-tab "play" buttons (Run + Stop).

The Run (▶) and Stop (■) buttons in the Configure & Run widget only work if a
three-part contract holds, and each part can be broken by an unrelated refactor:

  1. the HTTP endpoints the buttons call stay registered, with the right method
     (POST /api/composite-test-run, GET …/status, POST …/stop);
  2. those endpoints' handler views stay importable and behave; and
  3. configure-run.js keeps rendering the buttons and wiring their onclick to
     those endpoints (POST run → read run_id → poll status → POST stop).

These tests fail loudly if any leg is removed or renamed, so the buttons can't
silently stop working. (The endpoints' full behaviour is covered by
test_composite_test_run_views_lib / test_run_stop / test_composite_stop_views_lib;
this file guards that the button→endpoint wiring stays intact.)
