"""Thread-C / Task 1 (C1a): 'Spine at a glance' summary panel.

The study page gets a compact panel at the TOP (above the tabs) that
re-presents the spine's ALREADY-COMPUTED A+B content in one glance — verdict,
why (primary finding), acceptance, readiness, next — each row linking to its
detail tab/section. No recompute; AI-free.

Python-testable: ``_study_detail_spec`` surfaces ``spine_acceptance`` — the
owning investigation's PERSISTED ``executive.computed_acceptance`` criterion(s)
covering THIS study (pure disk read, no recompute). The render layer has no JS
harness → structural-tested (assert the markup/data references).
