"""C5 — dissolve the Overview "Plan & provenance" grab-bag into the acts.

The five P&P sub-blocks are RELOCATED (moved, not duplicated) from the
Overview panel to the act each belongs to:

  pipeline_gate / key_assumptions / limitations  -> Decide (conclusions) panel
  expert_decisions_needed                        -> Decide, under "Open debts"
  literature_anchors                             -> Tests panel

Assertions: Overview no longer renders any of them (nor the "Plan & provenance"
heading); Decide/Tests each render their moved block exactly once page-wide;
the G7 attribution line on the expert-question card survives; and a study
MISSING these fields renders none of the moved blocks (no empty boxes).
