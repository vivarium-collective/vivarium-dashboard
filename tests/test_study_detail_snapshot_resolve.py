"""Regression: study-detail.js must detect snapshot mode race-free.

The body.snapshot class is only added on DOMContentLoaded (walkthrough.js), so a
resolve that fires during initial render can read it as false and fall through to
the LIVE /api/...?query route, which 404s in a static bundle -> the Model tab
showed 'Could not resolve "<composite>"'. The fix mirrors configure-run.js: prefer
the authoritative __DASH_CONFIG__.mode signal (set synchronously inline) with the
body class as a fallback, via a shared _isSnapshot() helper used at every
static-vs-live URL decision.
