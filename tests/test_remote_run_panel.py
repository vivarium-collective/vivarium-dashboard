    remote-run thin client (build → poll → submit → poll → land) had zero
    live callers once its DOM anchors (#remote-run-panel/-btn/-progress) were
    removed from study-detail.html by Task 8 — `_initRemoteRunPinned` was
    still invoked from the template but its own `getElementById('remote-run-

    #study-run-current-spec (the SAME single header button, not a new one;
    items 18/19 are about eliminating a run-button choice, not adding one
    back) is mode-aware: remote-pinned deployments dispatch via the minimal
    `_dispatchCurrentSpecBaseline`/`_dispatchRemotePinned` pair and
    `/api/remote-run-submit`, everything else keeps the local-engine path.

    functions below came back, and `/api/remote-run-build`/`-land`/`-poll`
