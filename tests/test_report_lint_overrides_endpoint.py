"""Phase 2.1d — GET /api/report-lint applies `.pbg/report-lint-overrides.json`
server-side, the same way the old `/viva-report` skill/CLI did for Pass B
(`viva_superpowers.report.render_workspace_report`'s lint step, via
`report_linter.apply_overrides`).

Before this change the endpoint ran the linter but never consulted the
override file, so a finding downgraded via `--force` still showed up as a
blocking error in the endpoint response — the skill had to re-run/re-derive
the override logic itself to know better. `build_report_lint` now applies the
override file before shaping the response.
