"""UI: Rerun/Reproduce buttons (Task 7, updated by Task 4).

Thin smoke tests over the served HTML/JS for the Rerun/Reproduce affordances:

  1. Sim DB row action (``static/sim-table.js`` ``_actions``) — a per-row
     ``↻ Rerun`` control. reproducible-rerun-spine Task 4 repointed this at
     ``POST /api/study-reproduce`` (manifest replay) — "Reproduce" vs "Run
     current spec" is a deliberate, named distinction (see
     ``test_study_reproduce_button.py``). study-reproduce is the sole replay
     endpoint; the redundant generic ``/api/run-rerun`` was folded into it.
  2. Investigation header (``templates/index.html.j2``) — an
     ``#investigation-rerun`` button (Task 4 relabeled it "Run current spec"
     — it still re-derives from each member study's current study.yaml via
     ``/api/investigation-rerun``; an investigation-level "Reproduce" is
     explicitly out of Task 4's scope, left for Task 7's DAG-ordered work).
  3. Study-detail header — a "Rerun study" control (exercised indirectly via
     ``static/study-detail.js`` containing the wiring; the served-page
     assertion here focuses on the two pieces above, per the brief).

These are cheap "the wiring exists" checks against the live FastAPI app (via
``dashboard_client``), not exhaustive behavioral tests — behavior of the
endpoints themselves is covered by ``test_api_rerun.py``.
