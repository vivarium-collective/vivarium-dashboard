    """The isolation itself, asserted — otherwise it can regress silently and
    the only symptom is tests quietly talking to real infrastructure again.

    Checks the property where it actually matters: inside the SPAWNED server
    subprocess, which is the process that resolves builds and dispatches runs.
    Its base must be conftest's closed port, never the localhost:8080 default
    that a developer's SSM tunnel to sms-api-stanford-test occupies.

    Takes the expected value by REQUESTING the autouse fixture (which yields
    it) rather than importing the module constant. `from tests.conftest import
    ...` works locally but not in CI, where a dependency ships its own
    top-level `tests` package and the import resolves to
    site-packages/tests/__init__.py -> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
    'nose'. The fixture is the same value with no import-path ambiguity."""
