"""Wiring test for study `kind` reaching the study-detail template context,
plus (Task 4) real served-HTML assertions for the restructured header.

The `data-study-kind=` HTML attribute itself is added by study-detail.html in
a later task (Task 4), so there is no markup to assert on yet. Instead this
captures the kwargs `render_study_detail_html` passes to Jinja2's
``Template.render()`` (i.e. what the template sees as ``study.kind``) by
stubbing out template rendering — proving the wiring without depending on
markup that doesn't exist yet.
