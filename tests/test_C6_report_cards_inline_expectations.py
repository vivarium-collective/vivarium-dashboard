"""C6 — report cards expand inline at each behavioral test row, and
`literature_anchors` (moved into Tests by C5) render as an "Expectations"
band using the G3 outcome_label vocabulary.

Part A: each `kind: report_card` row gets an inline expander (native
<details>) whose mount reuses _renderRichReportCard(card) (JS, lazy-filled
on first expand) instead of a "View report card ↑" scroll-away link to the
top panel. The separate top #report-cards-panel no longer remounts the full
per-card stack (that would double every card) — it is now
plotly-comparison-only, and disappears entirely (server-gated) when the
study has no comparison_plotly_url, rather than showing an empty box.

Part B: literature_anchors render under an "Expectations" heading; each
anchor's expectation/model_observable/source render, and where
status_in_v2ecoli is present it is routed through the outcome_label /
outcome_class / outcome_glyph filters (the same met / conditional-pass /
not met / not assessable vocabulary G3 established) instead of raw text.
