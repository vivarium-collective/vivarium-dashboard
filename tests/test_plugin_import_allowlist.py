"""Phase 3 lock-in: the workbench may import only a NARROW, DECLARED core of
``viva_superpowers`` modules.

This is the end-state of the rewire-first re-architecture (Phase 2.1). All the
investigation-science *compute* the workbench used to borrow from the plugin was
moved into ``vivarium_workbench/lib/`` during Phase 2.1k. What remains importable
from the plugin is a small, deliberate core: the workbench-free audit/evaluation
spine (also imported by v2ecoli/sms-ecoli, so it must never depend on the
workbench), a handful of compute modules that are transitively required by that
workbench-free core (so they cannot move without dragging the core into the
workbench), the ecosystem ledger, and the pre-server bootstrap helpers.

This test AST-scans the whole ``vivarium_workbench`` package and fails if it
imports any ``viva_superpowers`` module outside the allowlist below. It catches
both a moved module creeping back AND a brand-new plugin-compute dependency.

Adding to ALLOWED should be rare and scrutinized. The default answer for new
compute is to put it in ``vivarium_workbench/lib/`` (see the Phase 2.1k history),
or inline a trivial helper — not to widen the plugin surface.

The complementary import-linter contract in pyproject.toml forbids the specific
modules that were moved out (belt); this test is the allowlist (suspenders).
