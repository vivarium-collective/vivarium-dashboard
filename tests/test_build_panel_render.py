"""The Assurance section is reframed as a narrative — Tests = "the bar",
Audit = "is the bar sound?", Build = "was it earned?" — and the Build panel
renders the model-building loop as a trajectory (integrity ribbon + a per-test
signed-margin matrix when the loop-state carries verdicts, else an iteration
ladder with the real margin-delta values), plus a result / honest-give-up banner.

JS-source-membership + template-mount checks, matching the repo's existing
pattern (see test_sourcing_panel_render.py).
