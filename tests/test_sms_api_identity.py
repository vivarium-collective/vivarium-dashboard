"""The workbench forwards a signed-in GitHub login as caller identity.

Until now every workbench call to viva-api sent exactly `{"Accept": ...}`, so
every task it submitted landed with `created_by = NULL` -- unowned, and therefore
cancellable by anyone, including a CLI user with no connection to it. Meanwhile
the CLI, TUI and marimo GUI all offer an identity field. The asymmetry was
invisible from the workbench, which is the part worth fixing.

The subtle half, and the reason this is not a one-liner: `current_session()`
resolves a MACHINE credential (`VIVARIUM_WORKBENCH_GH_TOKEN`, a k8s Secret) when
no person is signed in. On a deployed workbench every user resolves to that one
account. Forwarding it would give them all the SAME identity -- so they could
each cancel the others' tasks while the record named a specific owner. That is
worse than anonymous: it looks like attribution and provides none.
