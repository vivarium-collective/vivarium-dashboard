"""Plan §A5 — the "Run" button converges onto run_jobs for v3 investigations.

The two orchestrators this plan set out to merge read DIFFERENT spec shapes,
which is why they never merged on their own:

    /api/investigation-run            investigations/<n>/spec.yaml       (v2)
    /api/investigation-run-unblocked  investigations/<n>/investigation.yaml (v3)

`vwb migrate-investigations` is the one-way v2 -> v3 rewrite, and the real
v2ecoli build carries 11 investigations, all investigation.yaml, zero spec.yaml.
So convergence is a delegation for v3, and v2 keeps its synchronous behaviour.
