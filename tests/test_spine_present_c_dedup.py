"""Thread-C / Task 2 (C1b): de-duplicate follow-ups (3->1) + outcomes.

Follow-ups appeared in THREE places (Overview, the Conclusions follow_up_studies
block, and discovery_implications.followup_study_proposals). C1b keeps ONE
canonical surface — the Conclusions/Decide tab — where authored follow-ups and
discovered proposals render together, clearly distinguished and de-duplicated by
id; the Overview occurrence becomes a short link to it. The Conclusions "latest
run outcomes" raw per-test table defers to the canonical Tests tab (thread B).

Structural (no JS harness): assert the markup/data references.
