"""Task V4 — the 'visualization_gap' readiness finding + its wiring into
GET /api/report-lint (feeding the existing "N readiness gaps" pill).
Recalibrated by Task Vcal into three outcomes (warning / info / silent),
driven by ``lib.viz_gate.study_visualization_status``'s ``gap_severity``.

Mirrors ``tests/test_report_lint_question.py``'s style for the lib-level
findings builder, plus a live-server test (via the ``dashboard_client``
factory) confirming the finding actually rides ``/api/report-lint`` and is
counted the same way the readiness panel counts gaps: ``severity in
{"warning", "error"}`` (see ``static/study-detail.js``'s
``_renderReadinessPanel``, which sums ``sev.error + sev.warning`` into the
"N readiness gaps" pill; "info" findings are notes, not gaps).
