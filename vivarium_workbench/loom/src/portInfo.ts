// A pure function that folds a port's several data sources (the process's
// _inputs/_outputs type schema, the raw authored wire target, and the resolved
// absolute store path) into the small shape the port hover tooltip and the
// Inspector render. No React, no DOM — unit-tested in isolation.

 *    (e.g. `unique → {active_ribosome, active_RNAP, active_replisome}` or
 *    `listeners → {rna_counts, monomer_counts, …}`). Such a port has no single
 *    leaf type, but it is not untyped — it is a tree. Report its immediate
 *    field names as `tree[a|b|c]`; `abbreviateType` collapses ≥2 fields to
