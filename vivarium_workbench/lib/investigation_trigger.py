"""Layer-4 endpoint logic: pull-or-compute ``trigger`` over an investigation.

Wraps ``process_bigraph.templates.trigger`` for the workbench:

  1. build the pbg investigation document from the workspace
     (:func:`vivarium_workbench.lib.investigation_composite.build_investigation_document`);
  2. call ``trigger(document, target, on_missing=..., commit=<ws HEAD>,
     root=<abs .pbg/artifacts>)`` — which fills each cached prerequisite with a
     ``CachedResults`` reference (pull), leaves the target open (compute), and
     prunes non-ancestors — returning the ``{pulled, computed, pruned}`` report;
  3. (optionally) launch the *target* study through the **existing** run
     subsystem (:func:`vivarium_workbench.lib.composite_test_run_views.composite_test_run`),
     wiring each *pulled* upstream artifact's store path into the target run's
     overrides (the same ``into`` mechanism ``artifacts.pipeline._default_compute``
     uses) — so "continue from here" reuses the cached upstream without
     recomputing it. No new runner is introduced; the pbg sub-document's single
     open (compute) node — the target — is what the run subsystem executes.

"Run this study" and "continue from here reusing cached upstream" are the same
call with different ``target_study`` values.
