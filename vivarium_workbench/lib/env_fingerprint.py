"""Reconstructable environment fingerprint for a run's manifest.

``compute_env()`` captures just enough about the surrounding software
environment — the workspace's git HEAD, key simulation packages' versions
(+ a best-effort git SHA when installed from a local checkout), a hash of
the workspace's ``uv.lock``, the Python/platform strings, and the caller's
already-computed cache fingerprint — that a rerun can tell whether it
executed under materially the same environment as the original run.

Every field is independently best-effort: a lookup failure degrades that
one field to ``None`` rather than raising, so environment capture can never
block a run from being recorded (reproducible-rerun-spine Task 2, item 2 /
G1). ``env_id()`` folds an env dict into a short, stable, order-independent
digest so two runs' environments can be compared with one string equality
check instead of a deep dict diff.
