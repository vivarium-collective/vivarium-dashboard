"""Investigation-as-composite building blocks.

A ``StudyStep`` is a process-bigraph ``Step`` wrapping one study. Prerequisite
edges are expressed as input wires so the engine orders StudySteps by data
dependency (design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-investigation-as-composite-design.md).

``update()`` dispatches each study run to the persistent env worker's
``run_study`` capability via the shared pool (same pattern as
``study_run_post.py`` / ``composite_flush.py``'s ``run_study_analyses``
dispatch). Tests may still run the walking-skeleton path — assign a list to
``_RUN_ORDER`` to record execution order instead of hitting a live worker
(used by the hermetic ordering tests in
``tests/test_investigation_steps_skeleton.py``).

    THE authoritative local-vs-deployment answer for every one of them
    "never by which button happened to be clicked". This path was clicking a
    button: it called the worker unconditionally, so a user who picked a
    materialized remote build — or a deployment that pins remote runs — still
    had studies executed in an env worker. `study_runs.launch_into_study`
    already threads the target into `run_core.invoke_run`; this did not.

    On ``deployment`` it raises rather than dispatching. Dispatching from inside
    a ``process_bigraph`` Step is a real design question — whether the Step
    blocks on a Batch job or the investigation composite itself becomes async —
    and inventing an answer here would bury it. Raising keeps the user's choice
    honored (their work does not silently run in the wrong place) and puts the
