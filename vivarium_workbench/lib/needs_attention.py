"""SP5 — the "decisions needed" scan (Active Investigation Framework, Guide layer).

A PURE, deterministic aggregator. It makes NO new judgment: it GATHERS + RANKS
the divergences/gaps SP1–SP4 already compute into one per-investigation ranked
list — the "what needs my decision" entry point a navigator should LEAD with.

The six signals (all reuse — none reimplemented):

  1. Uncovered acceptance criterion  — ``linkage_index.ac_gating_matrix(..)["gaps"]``  (high)
  2. Verdict divergence              — persisted ``pipeline_gate.gate_evaluator.diverges_from_authored``
                                        + per-test ``computed_outcomes[t]["reconcile"]=="divergent"`` (high)
  3. Open expert feedback           — ``feedback_actions.study_feedback_actions``    (medium)
  4. Phantom / not-in-structure observable — ``readout_validation.validate_readouts`` (high, OPT-IN)
  5. Param drift                    — ``param_enforcement.check_enforced_params``     (high)
  6. Stale finding                  — greenfield ``_stale_findings`` classifier       (low)
  7. Invariant regression           — ``study.invariant_check[]`` status invalidated/weakened
                                        (C-INVAR; high/medium)

Isolation invariant (the SP4b lesson): the scan is build-free and cheap by
DEFAULT — signals 1,2,3,5,6 read YAML only. Signal 4 (phantom observable) needs
a composite build, so it is opt-in behind an INJECTED ``observables_for_ref``;
with no ``observables_for_ref`` the scan omits signal 4 entirely.

Best-effort PER SIGNAL: one raising source must never sink the scan (mirrors
``linkage_index``'s per-study tolerance). The output is EPHEMERAL — never written
back to YAML. AI-free: deterministic aggregation only.
