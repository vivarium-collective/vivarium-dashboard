"""Compile a workspace investigation into a **runnable** process-bigraph
composite — the execution substrate for "investigation as a composite".

Distinct from ``investigation_composite.py`` (which builds a pull-or-compute
*trigger document*): this module builds an executable ``Composite`` state dict
whose ``StudyStep``s run the member studies and whose ``InvestigationAnalysisStep``s
run investigation-level analyses, ordered by the process-bigraph scheduler via
input/output store wiring. Design:
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-investigation-as-composite-design.md`` (§3).

Pure dict construction — deliberately imports NO ``process_bigraph`` (the Step
classes are referenced only by ``local:<Class>`` string address), so this module
+ its shape tests stay import-light.

    wired to every member study's result store.

    Ordering has two mechanisms, both expressed purely as input wires (no explicit
    scheduling code — ``process_bigraph``'s ``determine_steps`` reads the wires):

    1. **Real prerequisites** — a study's ``pipeline_gate.prerequisites``, filtered
       to entries that are members of THIS investigation.
    2. **Synthetic serial edges** — confirmed necessary in Task 1: independent
       steps (no wiring between them) run in NONDETERMINISTIC engine order, not
       declared order. A study with no real prerequisite is wired instead to the
       immediately-preceding declared member, turning a whole no-prerequisite
       investigation into a deterministic declared-order chain. (v1 is serial;
       dropping these edges for genuinely-independent studies is a later
       parallelism pass.)

    ``process_bigraph.Composite`` whose ``StudyStep``s/``InvestigationAnalysisStep``s
    execute in the order the scheduler derives from
    ``build_investigation_composite``'s wiring (real
    ``pipeline_gate.prerequisites`` edges, else the synthetic-serial chain that
    preserves declared order — see that function's docstring). This is the
    single execution entry point ``prepare_investigation`` delegates to for a
    full run (design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-investigation-as-composite-design.md,
    §Architecture 4).

    ``run_study_fn`` (optional, **tests only**): ``(workspace, study_slug) ->
    reply dict`` — when given, temporarily substitutes for the live
    ``env_worker_pool`` dispatch so a run can be exercised hermetically with no
    process-bigraph worker/pool. Implementation note: rather than monkeypatching
    ``env_worker_pool.get_pool`` (what the existing skeleton/dispatch tests do)
    or requiring callers to juggle ``investigation_steps._RUN_ORDER`` directly,
    this function temporarily swaps ``investigation_steps._run_study_hook`` /
    ``_run_analysis_hook`` for wrappers that (a) delegate to ``run_study_fn``
    when given, else the original hook (so production dispatch — including the
    ``_RUN_ORDER`` skeleton path other tests use — is unchanged), and (b)
    record execution order + the full reply for this function's summary. This
    is necessary regardless of ``run_study_fn``: the ``InvestigationAnalysisStep``
    output store only ever holds ``reply["written"]`` (see
    ``investigation_steps.InvestigationAnalysisStep.update``), never
    ``reply["errors"]`` — capturing at the hook is the only way to surface
    analysis errors here. The swap is restored in a ``finally`` before this
    function returns, including on a raised exception (fail-loud policy below).

    **Failure policy (v1):** fail-loud. If a ``StudyStep``'s worker call raises
    (rather than returning an error in its reply — the ``run_study``/
    ``run_investigation_analysis`` capabilities themselves never raise, but the
    engine or a stubbed ``run_study_fn`` might), it propagates out of
    ``Composite(...)`` uncaught and this function does not catch it — the
    scheduler aborts mid-graph and the caller (a detached run) is responsible
    for recording the failure. Errors reported *within* a reply (the
    ``errors`` list ``run_study``/``run_investigation_analysis`` return) are
    captured into this summary's ``errors`` without aborting — that distinction
    (in-reply error vs raised exception) is the only partial-failure handling
    v1 does. Continuing independent branches after a raised failure is a
    follow-up (not implemented).

    Returns ``{"investigation": inv_slug, "studies_ran": [...],
    "analyses": [...], "errors": [...], "study_results": {slug: reply}}`` —
    ``studies_ran``/``analyses`` are slugs/names in the order the scheduler ran
    them; ``study_results`` (additive, not in the design's minimal shape) maps
    each study slug to its full ``run_study`` reply, for callers (like
    ``prepare_investigation``) that need the run refs, not just the order.
