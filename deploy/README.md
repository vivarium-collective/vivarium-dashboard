# vivarium-workbench — container image

**This repo owns the workbench container image.** The Kubernetes **deployment
lives in [`viva-api/kustomize`](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/viva-api)**
(the renamed `sms-api` repo), where the workbench is deployed as a peer service
of viva-api — one deploy of viva-api brings the workbench up too. Keeping a
single authoritative home for the manifests (in viva-api) avoids "which
kustomize is real?" confusion.

See [`docs/REFACTOR-PLAN.md`](../docs/REFACTOR-PLAN.md) §2B (deployment & storage)
and §5C (demo track & rollout) for the decisions behind this.

## Image (approach A — combined)

The workbench must import the workspace's package (`pbg_v2ecoli`, via
`build_core()`) **in-process** to render, so it needs the *same* environment
v2ecoli runs in. The [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) therefore **mirrors
v2ecoli's Dockerfile** — clones v2ecoli, `uv sync`s its locked env *including*
the workbench's deps, then overlays this repo's workbench (`uv pip install
--no-deps .`) and serves. It then installs the **`pbg-ptools`** viewer plugin
explicitly (also `--no-deps`) — the workbench discovers it via the `pbg-*` scan to
render the Pathway Tools Omics Viewer; because the workbench itself is installed
`--no-deps`, nothing transitive is pulled, so the plugin must be added by hand.
The sim-runtime layers (upstream vEcoli/Cython, AWS CLI, Ray-on-Batch entrypoint)
are omitted — the workbench renders, it doesn't run sims. The v2ecoli workspace is
baked in at `/app/v2ecoli` (used to seed the deployment's workspace volume).

> A **v2ecoli sidecar** was considered and rejected for now: the workbench imports
> `pbg_v2ecoli` in-process, which can't cross a container boundary. A separate
> environment container is the right shape *later*, once the `EnvironmentResolver`
> port lets the workbench resolve the env over a boundary instead of importing it.

## Build + push

```bash
# linux/amd64 (the EKS nodes are x86_64) -> ghcr.io/vivarium-collective/vivarium-workbench:<git-sha>
deploy/build-and-push.sh [version] [org]
```
Then pin that tag in sms-api's stanford overlay (`images:` → `newTag`) and deploy
sms-api. (Requires `docker buildx` + a ghcr login.)

## Deployment (lives in sms-api/kustomize)

The workbench runs as a Deployment+Service in the sms-api EKS cluster, under the
`/workbench` ALB path prefix (`serve --base-path /workbench`), with its **own EBS
`gp3` PVC** (RWO, single replica) seeded once from the baked-in workspace by an
initContainer. What the manifests need:

- **One ARN** — the `WorkbenchTargetGroupArn` (an sms-cdk stack output) for the
  `TargetGroupBinding`. The sms-cdk `/workbench/*` + `/bigraph-loom/*` listener
  rules route to that target group.
- **No new secrets** — reuse the org `ghcr-secret`; **no** Postgres, IRSA, or AWS
  creds (the workbench delegates all compute/storage to sms-api over in-cluster
  HTTP), so no IAM role annotation either.
- **`SMS_API_BASE`** → the in-cluster sms-api service DNS
  (`http://api.<sms-api-ns>.svc.cluster.local:8000`) — the only backend.

The workbench `Deployment`/`Service` (in `kustomize/base`) and the overlay
additions (EBS PVC + `TargetGroupBinding` + pinned image tag) are maintained in
the **sms-api** repo.
